      <title>Ravens cheerleader hurt after being dropped during routine</title>
      <description>A Baltimore Ravens cheerleader was stretchered off the field after apparently landing on her neck during an aerial stunt on Sunday.

The woman, who has not been named, was reportedly thrown into the air during a routine at the Ravens' game against Tennessee Titans at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.



Witnesses said she was dropped by her teammates and landed on her head and neck.&#160;




She then reportedly did not move for several minutes as medical personnel rushed on to the field and attended to her, according to&#160;CBS Sports.&#160;

Getty Images photographer, Rob Carr, who shot photos of the scene, said that although the cheerleader was very still, she could be seen hyperventilating and crying as the game went on.



And not everyone was happy that the game continued while medical personnel attended to the injured woman.

      <title>Packers Player Blocks Punt By &#8216;Kicking&#8217; Ball Before Punter Does (GIF)</title>
      <description>The Chicago Bears were a disaster in all three phases of the game Sunday night.
The Bears were railroaded by the Green Bay Packers 55-14 in front of a national TV audience, their second embarrassing blowout in as many games The offense was horrible (three turnovers), the defense was atrocious (Aaron Rodgers threw six touchdown passes in the first half), and the special teams unit even got in on the &#8220;fun&#8221; in the second half.
Bears punter Pat O&#8217;Donnell got plenty of work in with four punts in the loss, but it was the one punt he didn&#8217;t get off that helped sum up the Bears&#8217; night.&#160;In the third quarter, yet another Chicago drive stalled and the Bears were forced to punt. Packers receiver Jarrett Boykin was left unblocked as he stormed through the line. He didn&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;block&#8221; the punt in the traditional sense. Instead, Boykin got his foot on the ball before O&#8217;Donnell could.

Bears coach Marc Trestman summed it up pretty well after the game.
&#8220;We broke down in all three phases,&#8221; he told</description>

      <title>Brandon Marshall on Bears' woes: 'We're not very good'</title>
      <description>The Chicago Bears found themselves down by 45 points before scoring  their first touchdown in the third quarter of Sunday night's game  against the Packers.
Losers of five of their last six games, the  Bears are caught in a downward spiral that will likely cause them to  miss the postseason for the fourth straight season. The team's roster  features loads of talent at skill positions, but the coaching staff  isn't getting the most out of its players. And that's just one reason  why both head coach Marc Trestman and GM Phil Emery are currently on the  hot seat.
Brandon Marshall left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with an ankle...</description>

      <title>The Chicago Bears suck. Especially on defense.</title>
      <description>How f*cking terrible is the Chicago Bears defense? Historically f*cking terrible. And I&#8217;m talking the type of history that&#8217;s so old it predates the birth of the useless slab of flabby meat formerly known as Lance Briggs, who rode a goddamn brontosaurus to school and now eats a whole one as his pre-game meal.
Never in my life did I think I&#8217;d see the Bears lay out a sack of complete, flaming sh*t that would make their Halloween-night blowout to the Packers in 1994 look like a walk in the park by comparison. But lo and behold, Mel Tucker&#8217;s defensive unit that would be better served by 11 guys in wheelchairs and a mannequin calling plays finally delivered at creating an even more unpalatable sh*tshow.
With Sunday&#8217;s Ebola-laden effort in Green Bay, the Bears became the first NFL team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow 50 points in consecutive games.
Who in the flying f*ck are the Rochester Jeffersons? I don&#8217;t know either, so I looked it up for you.

      <title>Denver's backup QB can't believe Peyton went back out there</title>
      <description>Midway through the second half of today&#8217;s Broncos/Raiders game, the Broncos held a sizable advantage over their AFC West counterparts. It was such a big lead that backup quarterback Brock Osweiler thought he might be getting some playing time. When the Broncos gained possession, Osweiler went to fetch his helmet, only to turn around to

      <title>Report: Carson Palmer suffered a torn ACL</title>
      <description>Just days after signing a three-year, $50 million extension, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer exited the team&#8217;s game against the St. Louis Rams on Sunday afternoon with an apparent knee injury.

Despite Palmer clutching his ankle, reports from Fox indicates that it&#8217;s some sort of right knee injury. After returning to the sideline, Palmer was carted off to the locker room for further evaluation.
Drew Stanton replaced him in the lineup.
Palmer&#8217;s official status is questionable with a knee injury.

Update on Carson Palmer is left knee injury, return questionable

We will have more information as it becomes available.

      <title>Cowboys WR sends profane tweet to fan</title>
      <description>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Cole Beasley likely wishes he could  block Sunday's game against the Jaguars from his memory. He caught only  one 11-yard pass in the 31-17 victory, but fumbled at the end of the  play (pictured above).
It wasn't a banner day for the slot  receiver. So he did what was probably the worst possible move, and took  to Twitter discuss it with fans. He was quite defensive about the  fumble, as he rarely turns the ball over...</description>

But the Steelers would not go  quietly, and did everything they could to give themselves an opportunity  to get back in the game.
That includes attempting to wreck the Jets' victory formation.
When  QB Michael Vick prepared to take a knee late in Sunday's game, everyone  expected the Steelers to go quietly and allow the clock to run out. But  they didn't. As soon as the ball was snapped,&#160; FS Mike Mitchell came  flying in...</description>

      <title>Report: 20 Cowboys players broke curfew in London</title>
      <description>Some members of the Dallas Cowboys apparently wanted to explore London this week.
NFL Media&#8217;s Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that 20 Cowboys players missed their Friday night curfew ahead of the team&#8217;s Sunday afternoon game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

#Cowboys sources: A whopping 20 players missed curfew on Friday night. Coaches are frustrated. Veterans, too. Are they taking it seriously?
&#8212; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 09, 2014
It&#8217;s not like one of London&#8217;s most famous landmarks is a giant clock or anything.
The missed curfew might not be a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but it&#8217;s not a good look for a team that&#8217;s fighting for a playoff spot and is coming off a loss last week. &#160;The Cowboys will play the Jaguars on Sunday before hitting their bye week.
