					<h3>About Football by Football</h3>
					<p>FootballByFootball.com is a football analysis website providing unique player-writer generated content; owned & operated by experienced football players. 
					 
					<p>Experience counts immensely—especially in analyzing the world’s most complex sport.  A tiny percentage of the writing population has football experience.  This is a disparity we aim to change.     
					 
					<p>Football fans crave insight.  So, when the world orders a steak, you don’t butcher a chicken. 
					 
					<p>Welcome to FootballByFootball.com.
