      <title>Fantasy thinkTank: NFL Week 10</title>
      <description>
        
          

&lt;p&gt;Now that each team has played 8 games and we’ve technically
reached the halfway point of the season, let’s journey into the “Think Tank” as
I touch on random subjects that have peaked my interest through the first half
of the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Tom Brady is the best QB in football&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I’m a huge fan of Peyton
Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and the surging Ben Roethlisberger.&nbsp; But what
Brady has done this season is remarkable. The Pats have pieced together a rag-tag line in front of Tommy Boy and circled him with #2 &amp; #3 WRs with
specialized skill sets, yet he continues to throw up monster numbers.&nbsp; Some
were calling for Jimmy G after the debacle in KC, but Brady rallied the troops,
Gronk got healthier, and the rest is history. The schedule gets tougher after
the bye, but the Pats have set themselves up nicely for another playoff run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Bruce Arians is a mad scientist (usually this
moniker is for Bill Belichick only)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone said they believed the
Arizona Cardinals would be 7-1 mid way through the season, you’re either a
die-hard Cardinals fan or full of sh%t. The coaching job Arians has put forth
to date has been outstanding. On offense, he draws up the perfect plays to
maximize what his skill guys do best.&nbsp; On defense, his coordinator – Todd
Bowles – and his crew haven’t missed a beat after losing Karlos Dansby to free
agency, Darnell Docket to season-ending injury, and Daryl Washington to
suspension... not to mention other key injuries throughout the season. Yet, they continue
to win games and have built up a head of steam as they enter a tough stretch of
games during the months that truly define “champions”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Ben Roethlisberger should be included in the
discussion of the best QBs in the NFL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Big Ben feels like one of the Three Stooges. “I get no respect,
NO RESPECT!”&nbsp; Big Ben has won two Super Bowls – the first at the age of 23 – and
ranks in the top 2 of most statistical categories for QBs in 2014. After a slow
start, he has the Steelers in the thick of the AFC North playoff race and
should be in the discussion for league MVP. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;The Raiders are better than their record
indicates but they’re still pretty terrible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raiders have actually played better since Tony Sparano took
over the team. They’ve been competitive in most games and their offense and
defense have flashed big play capabilities. That being said, they have a brutal
schedule to finish the season and could very well go 0-fer the rest of 2014.&nbsp; I hope the
Raiders can put one complete game together this year so the Black Hole can flip
off a team after a win instead of another frustrating loss.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>Wading Through College Football Playoff Chaos</title>
      <description>
        
          This week,&nbsp;Mississippi State and Florida State remain the only undefeated teams in the playoff selection committee&#39;s rankings,&nbsp;so they continue to hold the top two spots.&nbsp; That&#39;s where the certainty in the college football rankings ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest difference between these two teams going forward is Florida State will not see another formidable opponent until the ACC championship game, while Mississippi State has to play Alabama and finish the season vs Ole Miss in the &quot;Egg Bowl.&quot; &nbsp;Mississippi State will drop one of those two games in my opinion, which will then throw a wrench in how the SEC will play out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s have some fun and examine the SEC scenarios. &nbsp;This past week&#39;s losses by Georgia and Ole Miss help to slightly clean up the picture for the college football playoff in the SEC. &nbsp;Georgia, now a 2-loss team in the weaker SEC East division, will not be a possibility for the playoff. &nbsp;Ole Miss is a long shot now after a tragic loss to Auburn this past weekend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ole Miss may very well be one of the best teams in the country, but the brutal schedule they&#39;ve had (and still have) to endure is too much to remain in contention.&nbsp; The equally brutal loss of wide receiver Laquon Treadwell to injury certainly doesn&#39;t help (below).&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Why Tony Romo SHOULD Play Sunday Against the Jags</title>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Should Tony Romo start at
quarterback Sunday in London against the Jacksonville Jaguars?&nbsp; That&#39;s
the pressing question right now as the Dallas Cowboys enter an extremely important stretch
of their season.&nbsp; The knee-jerk
reaction would be &quot;NO!&quot;...especially since the Cowboys are playing one of the worst teams
in the NFL.&nbsp; Back injuries are painful, and you might as well go with back up Brandon Weeden and give Tony Romo
another week of rest. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not going to play doctor in this column.&nbsp; Instead, I&#39;ll just acknowledge that in my NFL experience, every player (or person for that matter) has different levels of pain tolerance.&nbsp; And every injury in the NFL is unique.&nbsp; Playing doctor from the outside can be just as unwise as seemingly ignoring medical advice from the inside.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Romo is a huge long-term investment for the Cowboys.&nbsp; And as always, we don&#39;t have all the information.&nbsp; What may be seemingly reckless on the outside often isn&#39;t with more details.&nbsp; If the Cowboys&#39; team doctors have determined that Romo isn&#39;t significantly risking further damage, and the issue is just tolerance of pain, it&#39;s not necessarily a risk at all.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So putting the medical portion of this away and assuming that Romo is going forward with a more-informed medical thumbs up, what if I suggested to you that the &#39;it&#39;s just the Jags&#39; attitude is a very real football risk? &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going with Brandon
Weeden may potentially give the Jacksonville Jaguars an opportunity to get a
big win against a Cowboys team with plenty of divisional and playoff seeding implications on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;As I studied the game film of the Cardinals&#39; reaction to the Weeden substitution, it became apparent that with Brandon Weeden at the helm, there is no NFL defense on the face of the earth
that will give that Dallas Cowboys offense a favorable look to run the ball
against (below).&nbsp; This is a very big deal, because as detailed here on FBF throughout the year, no team in the NFL uses its run game to create more offensive opportunity than the Cowboys.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Believe Bowl: Browns at Bengals on TNF</title>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;November football doesn’t get any better than tonight&#39;s matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and their bitter division rivals four hours to the North, the Cleveland Browns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While always a battle between two teams and fan bases that don’t like each other, this year’s version is of greater significance because the fans of both franchises have been reluctant to fully buy into their respective team... &lt;i&gt;mostly because of decades of futility and hope-shattering defeats.&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp; But a Thursday nigh win in&nbsp;prime-time will mean the faithful can firmly plant themselves on their respective bandwagon as the ride to the playoffs begins!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of this matchup is two opposing quarterbacks who just can’t seem to win over their fan bases.&nbsp; Bengals signal caller Andy Dalton, in his fourth year, has led the team to an AFC North-leading 5-2-1 record, is enjoying his highest career completion percentage (64.9%), and is taking care of the football with only 6 INTs (on pace for 12) versus a career-high 20 last season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all remarkably impressive considering he’s done this without having the explosive weapons he was supposed to have when the season began.&nbsp; The would-be #2 WR Marvin Jones has missed all year and is on IR with a foot injury.&nbsp; TE Tyler Eiffert , who the Bengals practically designed their entire passing game around in the preseason, is currently on IR with an elbow injury.&nbsp; Star WR AJ Green has three games missed with a toe injury.&nbsp; Stud RB Giovanni Bernard has missed time as well.&nbsp; With all this said, Dalton can’t seem to get more than a tepid review from fans in Cincinnati. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tepid reviews, Browns QB Brian Hoyer can’t get any love from Cleveland fans either.&nbsp; Hoyer last week threw&nbsp;for 300 yards and two TDs against the Buccaneers&nbsp;(including one late for the win) while&nbsp;leading the jaded Browns franchise to its 5th win and first relevant November victory in seven years. &nbsp;Despite all this,&nbsp;Hoyer was at times booed on Sunday by the Cleveland faithful! &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s a guy gotta do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But&nbsp;a solid performance, and most importantly a win by either Dalton or Hoyer, will allow the hesitant&nbsp;fan bases to finally push all their chips into the middle and believe.&nbsp; Here are some of the key match ups of this Thursday night contest:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Browns C Nick McDonald vs Bengals DT Geno Atkins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Browns offensive line took a big hit when All-Pro Center Alex Mack was lost for the season two weeks ago with a broken leg.&nbsp; In his place stepped in Nick McDonald, who wasn’t even on an NFL team in 2013.&nbsp; Since then, McDonald has made his first two career starts.&nbsp; While showing some promise, has also looked bad at times, including an internet-sensation sack surrendered to Gerald McCoy. &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is good news for Bengals DT Geno Atkins, who is just now one year removed from an ACL injury.&nbsp; Before his ACL tear last year, Geno Atkins was arguably the most explosive interior defensive lineman in the NFL not named JJ Watt.&nbsp; Atkins has been slow to bounce back from the ACL tear, but has gotten stronger every week.&nbsp; Last week versus the Jaguars you started to once again see the disruptive force he can be.&nbsp; Look for a now-healthy and confident Geno Atkins to try and emerge versus McDonald.&nbsp; However, if McDonald can continue to progress and spark the stagnant Browns run game, it could be trouble for a Bengals front seven that hasn’t looked good for most of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tony Romo&#39;s Decision-Making Must Improve</title>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Jason
Garrett, Jerry Jones, and Tony Romo have made hopeful public statements this week that Romo will be able to play
Sunday in London against the Jacksonville Jaguars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After
Tony Romo suffered a hard blow to his back two weeks ago against the Washington Redskins,
reportedly fracturing two small transverse process bones in his back, the
Cowboys decided it was in everyone&#39;s best interest for him to take time off to
recover.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tony Romo&#39;s courage
and toughness should never be questioned. He’s proven time and time again he’ll
sacrifice his body for his team, fans and franchise.&nbsp; He&#39;s as tough as they come at the QB
position.&nbsp; Having suffered the same herniated
disk injury that Romo had surgery on this offseason, I can only imagine the
pain he’s dealing with—even if the new injury is officially deemed unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Romo’s
back itself may be cause for concern for Cowboys fans, but I&#39;m more concerned that his play in the final moments of the Redskins game indicates how he&#39;ll continue to play through this injury if given the chance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the Washington game, it didn&#39;t appear that Romo was seeing
the field well. Skins defensive coordinator Jim Haslett continued to stack the
box to stop the run, bringing various pressures throughout to harass and confuse Romo. &nbsp;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case
in point, in the final two minutes of the game, the Dallas Cowboys were backed
up with an opportunity for a comeback—similar to the one Romo led a year ago
against Washington when he initially herniated the disc in his back. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On
2nd down, Washington brought another zone pressure that surprised Romo.&nbsp; The photo below shows the
center identifying the offensive line’s assignment, leaving the LB on the right
the blocking responsibility of running back DeMarco Murray.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Wire:  NFL Week 10</title>
      <description>
        
          
&lt;h1&gt;QBs&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Mark Sanchez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Sanchize is back!&nbsp; Mr. Butt Fumble took over
for an injured Nick Foles and led the Eagles to victory over the Texans. With
Foles scheduled to miss the next 6-8 weeks, Sanchez (running Chip Kelly&#39;s offense) is a must add for fantasy
owners in need of a QB.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Josh McCown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McCown is healthy, and Lovie Smith has decided to replace an
inconsistent Mike Glennon with the quarterback he chose to start the beginning
of the year. Lovie plays his roster moves close to the hip, so there’s no
telling how long McCown will keep the starting gig.&nbsp; He should suffice, at
the very least, as a bye week fill-in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;RBs&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Alfred Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arian Foster’s groin injury looked serious to me when I saw
the replay, yet the Texans stated that the injury isn’t. Only time will tell, but
Alfred Blue should be added based off Arian’s reaction and his injury history. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Terence West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Browns’ backfield is a mess, and it became more of a mess
on Sunday when West received the lion&#39;s share of the carries against the
Buccaneers. Your guess is as good as mine when determining who will get the
most carries this week, but West is worth a flyer in deeper leagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-color-red&quot;&gt;Adrian Peterson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Peterson case has been resolved and now the NFL must
decide when they will reinstate him and the terms of his punishment. There are
still a lot of unknowns when it comes to Peterson’s return, but who
wouldn’t clear a slot on their bench for one the greatest fantasy studs of all
time?&lt;/p&gt;
